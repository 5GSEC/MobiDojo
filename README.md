## Minor Issues
### 1. Remaing Names
![issue1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b983026-d09c-4409-af48-9f4394eaa5dd)
When we shut down the 5G network and click the "Check Status" again, the names of each module remain and we need to do "page refresh".

### 2. Tricky dropdown buttons
![issue2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8711b62d-6464-49a0-b043-96573a760d79)
Often the dropdown button cannot be grabbed.


## Major Issues
### 1. 5G-Spector Attack Simulation
I've used a compiled version of "Attack UE", But its volume is too huge to be uploaded on the github. So, I think we should use a docker image. This means that the code must be modified accordingly.

### 2. 5Greplay
I should update "install_dependencies.sh" later by using "https://5greplay.org/docs/guide/building-from-source/" this document.
